title: "Scientific Calculator"
---

import Task from "./src/components/task.tsx";
import Calculator from "./src/components/calculator/calculator.tsx";

This here, is a scientific calculator that implements operator precedence, and it also features
commonly used mathematical functions such as: sin, cos, tan, exp, log, etc.

The calculator is built in typescript, and features a lexical analyzer, a recursive
descent parser with operator precendence, and a bytecode interpreter.
In the future im also planning on implementing a typechecker.

In the future i may expand this into it's own small programming language, but for the time being this will stay a calculator.

#### Todo list

<Task>Add constants like "pi" or eulers number "e"</Task>
<Task>
    Allow user defined functions e.g. <code>f(x) = x * x</code>
</Task>

<Calculator client:visible />
